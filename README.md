## Introduction

**Turn a plain-text declaration in your note into a chart, table, timeline or diagram — rendered in place, with no external service and no change to your source file.**

- **Six block types, one contract** — Chart, DataTable, MetricGrid, Timeline, DecisionBox and FlowDiagram all read the same attributes whichever way you write them.
- **Two ways to write every block** — a tag (`<Chart …>`) or a code block (```` ```chart ````). Same result, so pick whichever survives your editing style.
- **Your data stays where it is** — inline CSV, JSON or a Markdown table in the note, or an external `.dataset.json` manifest elsewhere in the vault.
- **Errors never break the page** — a bad block renders one inline error box with the exact line range; the rest of the note renders normally.
- **Nothing is sent anywhere** — no network, no telemetry, no account, no code execution. Optional desktop global skill imports are local file writes that require an explicit opt-in.

## Requirements

- **Obsidian 1.13.0 or later.**
- **Reading view.** Blocks render in reading view only — Live Preview support is planned but not there yet. If you paste an example and see raw text, switch the note with `Cmd/Ctrl + E`.
- **`.md` and `.mdx`.** Obsidian opens `.md` natively. Mosaic additionally registers the `.mdx` extension so those files open in the Markdown editor too — this applies to every `.mdx` file in your vault, whether or not it contains a Mosaic block. If another plugin already claims `.mdx`, Mosaic skips the registration and everything else keeps working.

## Installation

**From Community plugins** (pending directory review): search for "Mosaic" in Settings → Community plugins once listed.

**Manual**: download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/GilbertzzzZZ/obsidian-mosaic/releases/latest), copy them into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/mosaic/`, then enable **Mosaic** in Settings → Community plugins.

**Optional agent guidance**: Mosaic's settings can import a complete, independently usable authoring reference as a skill or an ordinary Markdown guide. The default scope is the current vault; desktop users can explicitly opt in to a global skill destination under their user home. See [Import Mosaic guidance](docs/guides/agent-guide.md).

## Quick start

Paste this into a note and switch to reading view:

````text
<Chart title="Monthly signups" type="combo" x="month" bars="Trials" lines="Signups" labels="all">
```csv
month,Trials,Signups
2025-01,420,120
2025-02,480,140
2025-03,560,160
2025-04,530,150
2025-05,620,180
2025-06,700,200
```
</Chart>
````

The same block written as a code block, with attributes in a `---` block instead of on a tag:

````text
```chart
---
title: "Monthly signups"
type: combo
x: month
bars: Trials
lines: Signups
labels: all
---
month,Trials,Signups
2025-01,420,120
2025-02,480,140
```
````

Both forms hand the parser an identical structure, so every attribute below works in either one.

## Content blocks

| Block | What it does | Data sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Chart` | Line, bar, grouped bar, stacked bar, combo and dual-axis charts | Inline CSV, or external dataset |
| `DataTable` | Sortable data table with automatic column layout | Inline CSV / JSON / Markdown table, or external dataset |
| `MetricGrid` | Status-colored metric cards in an adaptive grid | Inline only |
| `Timeline` | Vertical timeline with status-colored milestones | Inline only |
| `DecisionBox` | Structured decision record, with a free-text fallback that never errors | Inline only |
| `FlowDiagram` | Auto-layout flow diagram (SVG) | Inline only |

<details>
<summary><b>Chart</b> — six chart types, inline or external data</summary>

`type` accepts `line`, `bar`, `grouped-bar`, `stacked-bar`, `combo` and `combo-dual-axis`. Omit it and Mosaic picks `line` for multi-series data, `bar` for single-series.

````text
<Chart title="Weekly active users" type="line" x="week" y="users" unit="people">
```csv
week,users
2025-W01,1240
2025-W02,1310
2025-W03,1180
2025-W04,1420
```
</Chart>
````

Chart also has a third form: a self-closing tag driven by an external dataset manifest, with time-range filtering and granularity roll-up.

```text
<Chart
  dataset="finance.dataset.json"
  type="combo-dual-axis"
  x="AnchorDate"
  bars="Revenue"
  lines="Margin"
  granularity="month"
  granularityOptions="month,quarter"
/>
```

Full attribute table and error catalogue: [docs/guides/chart.md](docs/guides/chart.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>DataTable</b> — inline table or external dataset</summary>

````text
<DataTable title="Open incidents" columns="id,service,severity,owner">
```csv
id,service,severity,owner
INC-104,checkout,high,alice
INC-108,search,medium,bob
INC-111,billing,low,carol
```
</DataTable>
````

`columns` picks which columns to show and in what order; leave it out to render every column found. Payload can also be JSON or a plain Markdown table.

Full attribute table: [docs/guides/data-table.md](docs/guides/data-table.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>MetricGrid</b> — status-colored metric cards</summary>

````text
<MetricGrid title="This week">
```csv
label,value,delta,note,status
Active users,12.4k,+5%,vs last week,good
Retention,42%,-3%,needs attention,risk
Avg order value,$88,+1%,flat,watch
```
</MetricGrid>
````

`status` normalises to four buckets: `good`, `risk`, `watch` and `neutral` (the default). A `delta` starting with `+` or `-` colors the card on its own, so `status` is optional.

Full contract: [docs/guides/metric-grid.md](docs/guides/metric-grid.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Timeline</b> — vertical milestones</summary>

````text
<Timeline title="Release plan">
```json
[
  {"date":"2026-01-06","title":"Kickoff","body":"Scope locked","status":"done"},
  {"date":"2026-01-13","title":"Design review","body":"Two open risks","status":"blocked"},
  {"date":"2026-01-20","title":"Build","body":"API integration","status":"active"},
  {"date":"2026-01-27","title":"Launch","body":"Not scheduled yet"}
]
```
</Timeline>
````

`status` normalises to `done`, `blocked`, `active` and `default`. No field is required — a row with everything empty just renders an empty node instead of an error.

Full contract: [docs/guides/timeline.md](docs/guides/timeline.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>DecisionBox</b> — structured decision record</summary>

````text
<DecisionBox title="Storage engine" status="accepted" owner="alice" source="RFC-001">
```csv
label,value
Decision,Use SQLite for local cache
Cost,Roughly two weeks of migration
Alternatives,Postgres (too heavy), flat files (no queries)
```
</DecisionBox>
````

`status` accepts `accepted`, `proposed`, `rejected` and `superseded`, each with its own accent color. DecisionBox is the one block that never errors on an unstructured payload — write a sentence instead of rows and it renders as prose.

Full contract: [docs/guides/decision-box.md](docs/guides/decision-box.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>FlowDiagram</b> — auto-layout flow diagram</summary>

````text
<FlowDiagram title="Incident response">
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "a", "label": "Alert fires", "type": "start"},
    {"id": "b", "label": "Page on-call?", "type": "decision"},
    {"id": "c", "label": "Resolve", "type": "end"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "a", "to": "b"},
    {"from": "b", "to": "c", "label": "yes"}
  ]
}
```
</FlowDiagram>
````

A row-based form also works — one row per node, with a `next` column generating the edges:

````text
<FlowDiagram title="Incident response">
```csv
id,label,type,next
a,Alert fires,start,b
b,Page on-call?,decision,c
c,Resolve,end,
```
</FlowDiagram>
````

Full contract: [docs/guides/flow-diagram.md](docs/guides/flow-diagram.md).

</details>

## Troubleshooting

**I see the raw text instead of a chart.** Blocks render in reading view. Switch with `Cmd/Ctrl + E`.

**My tag isn't picked up at all — the note shows it verbatim.** Three host-level rules govern tags, and all three come from how Obsidian splits paragraphs, not from Mosaic:

1. **The opening tag must sit on one line.** Breaking attributes across lines makes Obsidian treat it as an ordinary paragraph.
2. **No blank lines inside the tag body.** A blank line ends the HTML block early, so the fence and closing tag become separate paragraphs.
3. **The closing tag needs its own line**, spelled exactly like the opening one (`</DataTable>`, case-sensitive).

Attribute names must also be plain ASCII. **The code block form has none of these limits** — reach for it whenever a tag misbehaves or you need non-ASCII attribute names.

**I get "Provide either dataset= or an inline body, not both."** The two data sources are deliberately exclusive: there is no sane way to merge an external dataset with inline rows, so Mosaic refuses rather than inventing a rule.

**A chart is blank but there's no error box.** Reading view renders sections lazily. Scroll the block into view; if it stays blank, reopen the note.

## Roadmap

- **Live Preview rendering** — the most requested gap; blocks currently render in reading view only.
- **More block types** — the six built-ins are the starting set, not the ceiling.

Detailed positioning and architecture notes: [docs/mosaic-intro.md](docs/mosaic-intro.md).

## Documentation

User guides in `docs/guides/` have English and Chinese versions, with English as the source of truth. Each reference guide carries the full attribute table, the payload contract and a catalogue of error messages.

- [Mosaic intro](docs/mosaic-intro.md) ([中文](docs/mosaic-intro-zh.md)) — positioning, architecture and roadmap *(English)*
- [Agent guidance import](docs/guides/agent-guide.md) — skill and ordinary-guide destinations, desktop global opt-in, update protection and retry behavior
- [Tag syntax](docs/guides/tag-syntax.md) — rules shared by all tag blocks, row extraction, fall-back-to-source cases
- [Chart](docs/guides/chart.md) — all three syntaxes, full attribute table, error examples
- [DataTable](docs/guides/data-table.md) — inline tables or external datasets
- [MetricGrid](docs/guides/metric-grid.md) — status-colored metric cards
- [Timeline](docs/guides/timeline.md) — status-colored vertical timeline
- [DecisionBox](docs/guides/decision-box.md) — structured label/value list, or free-text fallback
- [FlowDiagram](docs/guides/flow-diagram.md) — auto-layout flow diagram, graph JSON or row form
- [Dataset guide](docs/guides/dataset-guide.md) — dataset manifest contract, query semantics, troubleshooting

Design notes (why it works this way): [architecture](docs/design/architecture.md), plus one document per block type in [docs/design/](docs/design/).

Developer and maintainer workflow guides live in [docs/engineering/](docs/engineering/) and are English-only.

## Privacy and disclosures

Mosaic is fully local and fully offline:

- **No network requests.** Nothing is fetched, uploaded or phoned home.
- **No telemetry or analytics**, client-side or server-side.
- **No account, no payment, no ads.** Every feature works out of the box.
- **Content data stays inside your vault.** Dataset manifests are resolved relative to the note that references them and read through Obsidian's own vault API.
- **Optional desktop global skill access.** Skill imports default to the current vault. If you select `Global` and then click a skill import button, Mosaic writes the selected `mosaic/SKILL.md` outside the vault under the current user's home or another directory you choose. It subsequently checks that recorded destination once per plugin load so it can update only an unchanged file it owns. Global scope, directory choice and installation records are device-local to the current vault and are not synchronized. Mobile never accesses global skill files.
- **No global client configuration changes.** Importing guidance does not edit an agent client's configuration, launch an agent, create a symbolic link or scan for other files.
- **Clipboard: write-only.** Pressing a copy button writes a report to your clipboard. Mosaic never reads the clipboard, so nothing you copied elsewhere is ever seen.
- **No code execution.** No SQL, no formula evaluation, no scripts — declarations are parsed, never evaluated.

Charts are rendered by [Ant Design Charts](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-charts) (AntV), bundled into `main.js` under the MIT license.
